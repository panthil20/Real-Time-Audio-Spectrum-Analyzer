A real-time audio spectrum analyzer is a digital signal processing tool used to analyze and visualize the frequency content of an audio signal as it changes over time. It operates by continuously capturing audio data, applying mathematical techniques such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. The mathematical technique that is used FFT for analyzing and visualizing the frequency content of audio signals in real-time. It has applications in audio engineering, music production, speech analysis, and various fields where understanding the spectral characteristics of sound is essential.The theoretical understanding of its components, from audio input to frequency analysis and visualization, forms the basis for its implementation in software tools like MATLAB.
